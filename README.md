You only need to download a couple of files from this github site!  The rest are used by the installed VM.
 
1. The Installation instructions pdf. (choose one above) 
2. The Image File for the Virtual Machine. 

These instructions describe how to install software on your Windows or Mac, that runs linux in 
a Virtual Machine environment.  You don't need to know anything about linux to use it!   Don't worry,
the Installation steps seem to be quite long....just take them a one at a time.  I have tried to make it easy
on both you and me (less emails), so I've explained a lot of things you need need to know.


If you are linux savy, and would rather just use the scripting framework on your existing Linux box, see
the linux install pdf document for brief installation instructions.  This allows you to use your existing linux
environment such as Debian, Ubuntu or Raspian on a Raspberry Pi.  This guide will discribe how to install exactly
the same scripting framework used in the VM.   Once installed, it will self update in the same way the VM does. 

See MD380tools_Menu_installation_on_native_linux_KD4Z.pdf here:  
https://github.com/KD4Z/md380tools-vm/raw/master/MD380tools_Menu_installation_on_native_linux_KD4Z.pdf
If you run into something I missed in this brief document, please forward that information on to me
so I can update the document.

What does this thing do?

The VM allows you to create the latest firmware for the MD-380 / MD-390
series of radios from Tytera (TYT) and Retevis RT3/RT8.  It leverages the MD380tools project by
Travis Goodspeed found elsewhere on github.  It also downloads the whole dmr-marc contact
database into the radio.  

The VM provided provides simple single-word menu that is easy to
use, and does all of the heavy lifting of installing the MD380tools project files.
 
Other interesting tweaks in this VM make it stand out as producing better results than just
using other scripting or VM solutions.

* Automatically updates itself to the latest scripting and source code.  You will always, ALWAYS have the absolute latest features.
* That means you only have to install this stuff ONE TIME!
* Pulls current main branch of source directly from Travis Goodspeed's Github respository.  
* Single, one word commands to do the primary functions.
* Builds the "firmware" for radios having GPS and not having GPS.  No need to download firmware from websites.
* Builds the contact list on-the-fly, directly from the dmr-marc database.  Currently over 61K records worldwide.
* After running one command, the computer with the VM can be offline from Internet, and still write
firmware and the User DB (contact data) to the radio.
* Larger font on contact name with redline data separator in User DB modes / green line separator in Talker Alias modes.
* More detail in EU contact data.
* Support for private DMR IDs automatically appended in with the dmr-marc contact database. (via a static file or from an ftp server)
* Scripting framework functions can be extended for custom actions before firmware compilation,
after compilation, and after contact data is downloaded.
* Commands to save and restore firmware and contact data in snapshots.  Restores to a stable firmware if the latest gets sideways.
* Screen language defaults to English.  Six alternate languages available: Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, German and French!
* Lite weight version for Linux!  The scripting is all done using Bash scripts.  You can install just the scripting on Linux or Raspberry Pi.  Creates the exact same firmware.

Be sure to read the installation completely before emailing questions!  99% of all questions are
answered in the installation PDF.  If you are stuck, join the Facebook group mentioned above for help.

It's your choice.  You can use Oracle Virtual Box or VMware player to run this VM image.  Choose one, and select the correct image download below. 

** Please update to the most recent version of Oracle VirtualBox before installing this image

For the part files, download each one.  You will need to use the 7-zip program to extract them
back into the actual OVA Appliance file. 

Get 7-Zip here:  http://www.7-zip.org/download.html 
 
Install 7-Zip, and then Right-Click on the first part file, find the 7-Zip menu, and
choose the extract option.  You will end up with a single, large ".OVA" file.  This file is imported
into the Virtual Box software.


# THE VMWare Images are still for the version 3.0
# 4.0 version is not ready yet.. work in progress

* If you decide to use VMware instead of VirtualBox, use the following links, as this image has
been pre-converted for easier import into VMWare.

  If you can help translate into other languages, create a branch, and modify the
  "strings" script (found here), and request a pull.  Or send me the new language section in email.  

    
  Power Users!  You can customize the build process using your own bash scripting.  Callouts to user scripts are provided.
  prior to glv, after source download (before the Make), and after glv is completed.  So knock yourself out!
  
  A couple of quick notes regarding recent discoveries:
  
  1 - Unless you are using a PS2 style mouse (not a USB mouse), always configure Virtual Box to use a PS/2 mouse!
  That way, it won't try to steal your USB mouse.  The VM doesn't need your mouse anyway.
  In Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager, go to Settings / System / Change the "pointing device" to "PS/2 mouse"
  
  2 - If you have a hotspot, be sure to either turn it OFF or change your radio to a different channel such as an
  analog channel, BEFORE trying to use the flash / flashgps / flashdb commands.   The firmware flash cycle seems
  to be corrupted if the radio receives a signal during the flash steps.  If your radio reboots itself after first
  powering it up, remember this tip!
